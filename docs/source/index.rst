Welcome to Eapii
================

Eapii tries to make interfacing instruments easy. It does rely on any particular
communication format but rather defines a general framework to make easy to
write drivers with a minimum of code by automating most common operation,
such as conversion, unit handling and input validation.
Eapii is tested on Python 2.7 and 3.3+.
